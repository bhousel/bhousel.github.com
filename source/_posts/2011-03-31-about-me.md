{% img /images/me_winning.jpg 480 360 Winning. %}

This photo was taken right after I won second place in my age group at
a local 5k. I was a bit disappointed that they didn't rush over
and drape an American flag over my shoulders.

My wife called me a "tool" (rightly) and then snapped this photo of me savoring
the sweet metallic taste of almost victory.
