Wow, that’s a long list.
<!--more-->

At my first job, I mostly updated other people’s programs using
[C](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_%28programming_language%29),
[C++](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C%2B%2B),
[Visual Basic](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_basic), and even a little
[FORTRAN](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fortran).  I started to learn
[Ada](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ada_%28programming_language%29),
because at the time I thought it would be the next big thing.

Throughout college, I actually majored in
[Electrical Engineering](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrical_engineering),
so we had to learn other kinds of programming languages that most programmers
don’t bother with -- stuff like
[Labview](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Labview),
[Maple](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maple_%28software%29),
[MATLAB](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matlab),
[SPICE](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SPICE), and various
[assembly languages](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assembly_language).
In one class, we wrote a traffic light simulator in
[VHDL](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vhdl) and burned that code onto
[FPGA](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FPGA) chips, then hooked it up to
little red, yellow, and green LEDs on a breadboard.
And I took another fun class where we used
[Objective C](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Objective_c) to get a little Lego
robot to navigate around obstacles without falling off a table. 
I even won a t-shirt for that.

I also got a minor in
[Computer Science](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_science)
and, already knowing C, I was able to skip over a lot of courses.
There were some classes using the more esoteric stuff like
[Prolog](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prolog) and
[Scheme](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scheme_%28programming_language%29) --
those courses were fun for me.

For a while I had a job working at a company that sold a
[VRML](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vrml) and
[X3D](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X3D) toolkit built using
[C++](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C%2B%2B) and
[OpenGL](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opengl).  The parser library used
[Flex](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flex_lexical_analyser) and
[Bison](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU_bison), which I count as actual
languages worth knowing.  We also used some
[Tcl](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tcl),
[Java](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_%28programming_language%29), and
[JavaScript](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Javascript) there.

I picked up all the usual web stuff along the way, learning
[HTML](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Html),
[XML](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XML),
[CSS](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cascading_Style_Sheets), and
[JavaScript](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Javascript).  I also used
[PHP](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Php) and
[Perl](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perl) for some side projects.

My day job involves building enterprise legal applications.  The
[LawManager](http://www.lawmanager.com)
software that I use is written in
[Delphi](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CodeGear_Delphi), and uses
[VBScript](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vbscript) as a scripting language.
It also supports an older proprietary scripting language called EvLa,
and I’m probably one of only a handful in the world who knows it. 
The job also requires me to know a lot of
[SQL](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sql), both Microsoft
[T-SQL](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T-SQL) and Oracle
[PL/SQL](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PL/SQL) variants.

For a while, I got really interested in
[C#](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_Sharp_%28programming_language%29) and
[ASP.NET MVC](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASP.NET_MVC_Framework).

But my current favorite language is
[Ruby](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ruby_%28programming_language%29)
I've built a few projects in
[Ruby on Rails](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ruby_on_Rails).

Also, I don’t think you can exist in this business without knowing some
[shell scripting](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shell_scripting) and
[regular expressions](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regular_expressions).
