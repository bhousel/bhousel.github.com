title: What was your first professional programming gig?

One of the best decisions I made was to go to
[Drexel University](http://www.drexel.edu/) for my undergraduate degree,
because they basically require everyone to go on internships. You get your
degree in 5 years, but for the middle three years you alternate between 6
months of class and 6 months of paid internship. Drexel even had a required
class for all freshmen to teach you how to write a resume, how to interview,
how to act at work, etc.

So in 1995, my sophomore year in college, I went to work at my first
internship for a small consulting company called
[Gnostech](http://www.gnostech.com/).
I remember in the interview they asked me:

1. Do you ever work on programming projects on the side just for fun?  
("Yes, I’m working on an online game. I haven’t decided whether it will
be set in medieval times or outer space, so I’m trying to be as generic
as possible.")

2. Do you know the difference between C and C++?  
("Not really, they look the same, but I know in C++ you can change around
how the operators work.").

I guess those answers were good enough for them, so they marked me down as a
"qualified alternate" and I somehow got the job.

Gnostech was a typical small company, and they did all kinds of various
computer stuff for other companies in the area - which actually made it a
fantastic place to do an internship. One day I might be installing a network,
another day I’d be soldering components onto circuit boards, another day I was
writing software to test the circuit boards.
