title: What's the most fun you've ever had programming?

During the dot-com bubble in the late '90s
I worked at a startup company called
[OpenWorlds](http://www.openworlds.com/), just
me and a few other programmers in a small office. 
We were building a toolkit for using
[VRML](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vrml) and
[X3D](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X3D), which was
a kind of 3D version of the HTML that powers the world wide web. 
VRML never took off, for
[many reasons](http://www.softwaredeveloper.com/features/ghosts-in-machine-071207/)
that seem obvious now, but at the
time people were excited about anything involving the web or 3D graphics.

The best part of the job was traveling to conventions like
[SIGGRAPH](http://www.siggraph.org/)
to demo our software with a bunch
of other startup companies. They did this thing called the
[Web3D](http://www.web3d.org/) RoundUP where each company had a few
minutes to do a demo, and the audience, served alcohol beforehand, had
noisemakers to let you know how well the demo was going. If you went over
time, they’d shoot you with ping pong ball guns.  There was a lot of last
minute coding going on, and the demos were pretty crashy, but the whole party
atmosphere at the time was loads of fun.
