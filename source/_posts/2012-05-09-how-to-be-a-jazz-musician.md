It's awesome that you are asking questions and trying to learn more about jazz theory, but I think you might be getting bogged down in details and missing the bigger picture. Theory won't really make you a better musician. Back when I was playing a lot, I would meet old guys at clubs who would put me to shame, and they didn't know the first thing about theory.

My advice to you is:

1. Listen. To as much music as you can. I'm in my 30s, so back when I really got all nerdy about this stuff, they had those deals where you could get "15 CDs for a penny". I would sign myself up for those under all kinds of alternate names. Get them delivered at work, at my parents house, etc. There was a period of several years where I would just nerd out and listen to everything I possibly could. Nowadays, people probably just download music from torrents. I think you should pay for the music if you can, but don't feel too bad about not paying for it if you can't.

2. Play music all the time. Have your instrument ready to go, and play along with your CDs. Find jam sessions in your area and go to them. The first time you go, don't bring your instrument, just listen. Each jam session has a "character" and you want to make sure that, as a n00b, you can fit in. Some sessions are more n00b-friendly than others. Some have sign-in sheets, and are mostly music majors trying to outdo each other. But don't worry, because people are generally nice, and the bar for being a jazz musician is set much lower than you think. You don't need to know theory or modes, you just need to be willing to listen. You'll meet all kinds of interesting characters and you'll learn a ton about music, and probably a ton more about things outside of music.

3. Practice. This will take years, but you need to know your instrument inside and out. You need to know scales and arpeggios. How different playing techniques alter the sound. Practicing jazz means playing lots of jazz. I don't know of any better study aids than the Jamey Aebersold Play-a-long books. Start with Volume 21, "Gettin' It Together" which just gives you a CD of every key in major and minor, and a few common blues changes, and then play it constantly. Then add Volumes 1 (intro to soloing), Volume 2 (blues), Volume 3 (ii-V7-I). Then add any other volumes you are interested in (and there are hundreds). Again, these can be pirated, but I think you should buy them if you can afford them, as they are very worth it.

4. Learn the history. Read books about jazz, and nerd out on Wikipedia. Jazz is a constantly evolving artform, so to really understand it, you need to know the context of the times in which it was created. Imagine what it was like for the early blues artists. Then it evolved into a commercial success with big bands that would travel around and play at dance halls. Imagine being a musician like Charlie Parker or Dizzy Gillespie, who after playing the same music for years gets bored. They form small groups where they can really show off and the result is bop style. Coltrane comes along and gets bored with that and basically starts throwing different chords into the standard blues and rhythm changes. etc etc. Jazz is a conversation that took place over years. Basically (and this is the secret to everything in life) there are rules, then trendsetters break those rules in ways that lay down new rules, and this is a cycle that endlessly repeats itself. Miles "got" this more than anyone else.

Enjoy the journey!
